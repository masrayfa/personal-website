# Why Do People Misunderstood Us

<VersionContent version="short">

I usually observe people begging to be understood by the person they are speaking with.
Kneeling, raising our hands, and shoutting our words to their ears. Is it wrong?
Probably not, but i would say it's a waste of time. How could people be on the same page as we are,
when thoughts that linger in our minds are only finite by our heads?

So demanding that others comprehend us is unbelievably burdensome.
As much as we want to be heard, it is we who are pushing ourselves to the end of the hill of disappointment.

Some people are not meant to understand us.

Maybe they were just passing by and took a glance and laughed at us.

Does it mean anything? no.

They get busy with their own life right after that. so why worry?

I usually observe people begging to be understood by the person they are speaking with.
Kneeling, raising our hands, and shoutting our words to their ears. Is it wrong?
Probably not, but i would say it's a waste of time. How could people be on the same page as we are,
when thoughts that linger in our minds are only finite by our heads and spit it out by our limited dicts?
Moreover, the stories we tell about how we feel towards our cranky significant other
are just the top of the ice berg of what it causes.

So demanding that others comprehend us is unbelievably burdensome.
As much as we want to be heard, it is we who are pushing ourselves to the end of the hill of disappointment.
Looking down as if someone will catch us at 100 miles per hour. Only to be realized by Mother Nature, 
we are indeed sick by ourselves.

We got tricked by beautifully written quotes about human connection on a cup of coffee.
We are deluded by random soulmates contents on tiktok that moments later they are breaking up.
We are fooled by ourselves that people will understand us about why we love manchester united in the first place.

I too was one of the many people who fell for king MU (still a fan to this day), 
fell for the idealistic soulmate, fell for perfect-sounding relationship quotes written by imperfect humans.
And yet, I was also the one responsible for choosing to be disappointed by the person I cared about the most.
Even someone we intentionally choose to love can still miss the simple reason we'd prefer our porridge stirred.
Let alone strangers.

So let's settle it down.

Some people are not meant to understand us.

Maybe they were just passing by and took a glance and laughed at us.

Does it mean anything? no.

They get busy with their own life right after that. so, why worry?
