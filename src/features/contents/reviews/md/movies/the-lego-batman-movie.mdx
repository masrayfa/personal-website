# The Lego Batman Movie (2017)

<VersionContent version="short">
### What I felt when watching the film as a teen

When I first watched this film in 2017, it honestly felt meh. I was skeptical about the plot and assumed an animated movie wouldn’t offer much depth. To me, it was just Batman fighting villains with Joker at the center. Nothing more.

Turns out, I was wrong.

### What I felt when watching the film as an adult

Rewatching it at 24 hit completely differently. Suddenly I could see the layers: identity crisis, inner child issues, relationships, and—most of all—loneliness.
Bruce Wayne’s empty routine felt painfully familiar: crime-fighting by day, romantic movies alone by night, doing everything by himself in a huge, quiet house.

That solitude stayed until Robin, Barbara, and even Joker shifted his world. When Gotham became peaceful, Batman lost his purpose and spiraled—pushing people away out of fear he’d lose them too. His journey wasn’t just about saving Gotham, but confronting his own beliefs and finally admitting he cared about his new family.

### What I learned

Batman’s mindset changed, and so did mine.

> Sometimes losing people is part of life. But that doesn’t mean we stop letting them in.

Maybe losing someone isn’t an ending—just a sign that something new is on its way.

### What I felt when watching the film as a teen
Truth be told, if you asked me how I felt the first time I watched this film in 2017 (I was a junior in high school), I couldn’t tell you; besides, it felt meh.
I couldn’t deny that I was a bit skeptical about the plot, so in the back of my mind, it was just another movie I watched.
Maybe there was also a bit of cockiness that, since it’s an animated movie, I assumed it wouldn’t carry a heavy story. And it was slightly true.
It only showed Batman fighting against villains, with Joker at the center point. But was that really it?

Turns out, no.

### What I felt when watching the film as an adult
In my search for a comfort movie in my post-graduate life, I heard some buzz that The Lego Batman Movie was actually pretty decent.
So I rewatched it as a retrospective audience. It hit me harder than ever now that I’m a 24-year-old adult.
There’s an existential crisis, an identity crisis, an inner-child theme, parenting, relationships, and—my most relatable topic—loneliness.

As I watched, I couldn’t help but sense a strong feeling of commonality. The emptiness of Bruce Wayne every time his mundane routine (fighting bad guys and eradicating crime in Gotham City) was over.
Most days he just watched hopeless romantic films alone in his giant home theater.
Cooked alone. Had lobster thermidor for dinner alone. Literally did everything alone.

That stayed the same until Robin became his first adopted son, Barbara Gordon came along, and Joker surrendered himself.
Crime no longer existed in Gotham City. Batman lost his purpose. Batman lost himself. Batman’s "valid" crashed out.
After he lost everything, he tried to recreate the mess he was used to. And with his short temper, he sent Joker to the Phantom Zone—exactly what Joker wanted—then the chaos began.

During this chaos, he teamed up with Alfred, Barbara, and Robin unwillingly. He was in constant denial that he needed them.
As I watched this, I knew it wasn’t his intention to push them away. But I also knew that if he let himself go along with it, he might lose them too.
So there was an internal conflict throughout his journey to save Gotham. Not just an external battle, but an internal one.
His principles were put to the test. The code of conduct he’d upheld his whole life was shaken.
It wasn’t until he went through a sort of therapy session with the brick lady in the Phantom Zone that he could finally tell himself the truth—that he cared about his new family.
He stopped denying that he needed Joker to complete him as Batman (it really is like a toxic relationship -_-).

### What I learned from this film
We can see Batman’s false belief change. And it changed mine, too.
At the end of the movie, Batman says,
> Sometimes losing people is part of life. But that doesn't mean we stop letting them in.

So maybe losing someone isn’t the end of the world. It’s only a sign that something else is waiting, knocking on our doors.
