# Amsterdam Canals

## Venice of the North

Amsterdam's iconic canal system and unique architecture have captivated me for years. The city offers endless opportunities for visual storytelling - from its historic buildings to the bicycles, boats, and bridges that define daily life.

### What I Want to Capture:

- The UNESCO World Heritage canal ring at different times of day
- Classic Dutch architecture reflected in the water
- The famous bicycle culture and everyday street scenes
- Canal boats gliding under historic bridges
- The artistic neighborhoods and street art scene

### The Vision:

I envision a piece that captures Amsterdam's timeless charm and modern vibrancy. The challenge would be photographing a heavily-documented city in a fresh way - finding unique angles, playing with reflections in the canals, capturing the interplay of old and new.

The color palette: earthy brick tones, deep greens of the canal water, pops of color from flowers and bicycles.

**This is a manifestation.** One day I'll navigate these canals with my camera, telling my own Amsterdam story.
