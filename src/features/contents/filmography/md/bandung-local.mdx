# Bandung - Home Base

## My City, Through My Lens

While I dream of distant lands, Bandung is where my visual journey begins. This city has trained my eye and taught me to find beauty in the familiar. Every corner holds a story waiting to be told.

### What I'm Capturing:

- The Art Deco architecture that defines Bandung's character
- Morning fog over the tea plantations in Lembang
- The vibrant street food culture and local markets
- Gedung Sate and colonial-era buildings
- The creative energy of Bandung's youth and art scene
- Surrounding volcanoes and natural landscapes

### The Vision:

Bandung deserves to be seen with fresh eyes - not as a stepping stone to somewhere else, but as a destination worthy of cinematic storytelling. I want to showcase the layers: colonial history, natural beauty, modern creativity, and everyday moments that make this city uniquely Bandung.

The content mixes urban exploration with natural beauty, capturing both the gritty authenticity of street life and the serene landscapes just outside the city.

**This is home.** These are real captured moments, building my portfolio while dreaming bigger.
