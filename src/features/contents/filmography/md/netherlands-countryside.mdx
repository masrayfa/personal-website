# Netherlands Countryside

## Windmills, Tulips, and Endless Horizons

Beyond Amsterdam lies the quintessential Dutch countryside - a landscape of windmills, endless tulip fields, and horizons so flat they seem infinite. This is where I want to capture the Netherlands' pastoral beauty.

### What I Want to Capture:

- Traditional windmills at Kinderdijk
- Tulip fields in full bloom (spring)
- The geometric beauty of Dutch farmland from above
- Traditional Dutch villages with characteristic architecture
- The famous flat landscape and big skies

### The Vision:

A celebration of simplicity and natural beauty. The Netherlands countryside is perfect for minimalist cinematography - clean lines, bold colors (especially during tulip season), and that distinctive flat landscape that creates unique lighting conditions.

I imagine drone shots revealing the patterns of fields and canals, ground-level shots immersed in tulip fields, and intimate portraits of traditional Dutch rural life.

**This is a manifestation.** I will stand in a field of tulips, camera in hand, bringing this vision to life.
