# Australian Coastline

## Where the Ocean Meets the Sky

Australia represents the ultimate dream for any visual storyteller - vast landscapes, unique wildlife, and some of the world's most stunning coastlines. I dream of capturing the raw beauty of its beaches and the endless blue horizon.

### What I Want to Capture:

- The turquoise waters and white sands of the Great Ocean Road
- Sunrise over Bondi Beach, Sydney
- The dramatic cliffs and rock formations along the coast
- Surfers catching waves at golden hour
- The unique Australian coastal lifestyle

### The Vision:

A cinematic journey along Australia's coast - emphasizing the scale, the colors (those incredible blues and whites), and the sense of freedom. I want to capture both the peaceful, meditative moments and the dynamic energy of the ocean.

The footage would blend wide aerial shots with intimate details - footprints in sand, waves crashing against rocks, the play of light on water.

**This is a manifestation.** I believe one day I'll feel the Australian sun on my face while filming the Pacific Ocean.
